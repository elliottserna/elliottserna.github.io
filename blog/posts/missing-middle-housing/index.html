                    Last month, I visited the Griffith Observatory, one of the most remarkable vantage points 
                    that overlook Los Angeles. But beyond impressive views, its vantage also reveals the 
                    intrinsic ugliness of LA's urban design—an ugliness that has become all too common in cities 
                    across America.
                <p>
                    To see what I mean, look at this picture I took from the observatory's roof:
                </p>
                <br>
                <center>
                    <img src="griffithskyline.jpg" alt="LA Skyline From Griffith Observatory" title="LA Skyline">
                    <i>Photo of Los Angeles' skyline I took atop the Griffith Observatory in January 2024.</i>
                </center>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Look at the distinct drop-off in height between the towering skyscrapers of downtown and the 
                    low-rise commercial and residential areas radiating from it. Notice the sheer amount of occupied 
                    horizontal space in contrast to the amount of foregone vertical space. Sure, it's silly to call 
                    a city ugly because it's flat, but the issue LA's flatness presents goes deeper than mere aesthetics 
                    when you consider that America—with California in particular—is facing a housing crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    According to a Habitat for Humanity 2023 report, 31.8% of U.S. households 
                    <a href="https://www.habitat.org/costofhome/2023-state-nations-housing-report-lack-affordable-housing">were</a> 
                    cost-burdened in 2021, a figure that has <a href="https://www.jchs.harvard.edu/sites/default/files/reports/files/Harvard_JCHS_Americas_Rental_Housing_2024.pdf">reached</a> nearly 50% in following years. The same report 
                    <a href="https://www.habitat.org/costofhome/2023-state-nations-housing-report-lack-affordable-housing">describes</a> how record-low supply 
                    of options in American housing markets, paired with soaring demand of the growing American population, has 
                    created a housing unaffordability crisis, with Axios <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/12/16/housing-market-why-homes-expensive-chart-inventory">estimating</a> an unmet demand of around 3.2 million homes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how is that possible when, according to the Census Bureau, over 15 million housing units <a href="https://usafacts.org/articles/how-many-vacant-homes-are-there-in-the-us/">remained</a> unsold 
                    in 2022? That's where inefficient urban design comes into play.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developing almost exclusively low-density housing is a recipe for systematic unaffordability. Note: 74% of 
                    LA's residential space is <a href="https://belonging.berkeley.edu/single-family-zoning-greater-los-angeles">zoned</a> for land-intensive single-family units (SFUs). Decades of near SFU exclusivity 
                    in LA have created market conditions in which homebuyers must compete for limited units on limited land space, 
                    fueling bidding wars that <a href="https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/040215/how-does-law-supply-and-demand-affect-housing-market.asp">drive</a> prices up to stratospheric heights—an issue further compounded by the absence of 
                    housing types that can accommodate more residents per plot than SFUs or mid-rise apartments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But how about townhouses, duplexes, or even live-work units? Aren't those readily available too?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Well, that's just it. No, they're not.
                </p>
                <p>
                    These medium-density options <a href="https://missingmiddlehousing.com/about">are</a> the 'middle housing' of the 'Missing Middle Housing' phenomenon underlying this 
                    entire issue: attractive, robust <a href="https://www.ncsl.org/human-services/middle-housing-filling-a-gap-in-available-housing-options">alternatives</a> to SFUs and a key resource to solving the housing crisis.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Middle housing options allow developers to not only create more housing units per lot but also actively <a href="https://louisvilleky.gov/planning-design/document/benefits-middle-housing#:~:text=BENEFIT%3A%20Income%2C%20Equity%20and%20Empowerment&text=Because%20the%20entry%2Dlevel%20purchase,build%20equity%20while%20doing%20so.&text=%2C%20which%20is%20active%20and%20walkable.">facilitate</a> 
                    social integration within neighborhoods. To that effect, middle housing <a href="https://louisvilleky.gov/planning-design/document/benefits-middle-housing#:~:text=BENEFIT%3A%20Income%2C%20Equity%20and%20Empowerment&text=Because%20the%20entry%2Dlevel%20purchase,build%20equity%20while%20doing%20so.&text=%2C%20which%20is%20active%20and%20walkable.">leads</a> to smarter land use and higher affordability, 
                    as land costs are shared by inhabitants, housing supply is increased, and transportation costs are minimized as walkability 
                    increases.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Middle housing is great. So why don't we see more of it?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Admittedly, it's a loaded question. There are a multitude of factors that have <a href="https://youtu.be/cjWs7dqaWfY">relegated</a> middle housing to a bygone era, 
                    from disease and fire hazards in the twentieth century to racism (e.g., exclusionary zoning) to the rise of cars and highways. 
                    But the concise answer is that a history of protecting the 'character of single-family neighborhoods' has entrenched SFU supremacy 
                    into American planning policy, making middle housing an exception as opposed to the rule.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because for the past half century, single family development has been the rule. But lest we forget that, for centuries prior, 
                    SFUs were the exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The iconic townhouses and mixed-use apartments of NYC and San Francisco are prime examples of the way middle housing used to be the norm 
                    in America before the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=imAGg5Lj8lc">suburbanization</a> of cities during the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Even Los Angeles—a city that <a href="https://www.construction-physics.com/p/how-the-car-came-to-la">developed</a> with 
                    the streetcar and suburb—still had elements of middle housing with lofts and live-work dwellings <a href="https://loftway.com/buildings/pan-american-lofts/">lining</a> the early downtown. To say, then, 
                    middle housing has always been missing is just not true—even in a place like LA.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h2 id=solutions>So here's how we bring back 'Missing Middle Housing:'</h2>
                <br>
                <p>
                    Today's Los Angeles isn't alone in suffering from the 'Missing Middle;'
                    suburban sprawl has become commonplace across the United States. 
                    Thankfully, middle housing can be integrated into any locality with careful planning.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Using the great work being <a href="https://ternercenter.berkeley.edu/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Missing-Middle-Brief-December-2022.pdf">conducted</a> by researchers like those at the Terner Center 
                    For Housing Innovation as a basis, the answer to bringing back middle housing lies in 
                    changing the rules of planning. Updating zoning codes to allow non-SFU dwellings to 
                    legally exist is important, but it doesn't spur new development. Cities should reexamine 
                    regulations that dissuade developers from building medium-size facilities, like <a href="https://youtu.be/iRdwXQb7CfM?si=MlQDhWJB607a5-oY">mandating</a> 
                    stairwell minimums per building, and streamline approval processes that have historically 
                    slowed the development process and increased start-up costs. Furthermore, states should 
                    facilitate inter-city adoption of these reforms by providing robust requirements for new 
                    multi-family developments as well as provide incentives for cities to go above 
                    baseline reforms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    And of course, this list is not all-inclusive. But with these three recommendations as a 
                    starting point, cities like Los Angeles across the United States can shed their ugly flatness 
                    and shine as beacons of responsible planning and urban design.
